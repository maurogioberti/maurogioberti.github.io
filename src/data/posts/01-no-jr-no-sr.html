    Every expert once started as a beginner. Every Sr developer was once a Jr. And in that journey from novice to pro lies the true essence of growth.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Think about it. Every senior developer, every lead engineer, every CTO started somewhere. They were once the newbie, the greenhorn, the rookie. They had
    questions, made mistakes, and looked up to their mentors for guidance. This mentorship, this guidance, is the foundation of their transformation.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Being a mentor isn't just about expertise. It's about remembering your roots, guiding with empathy, and inspiring the next generation. My time educating
    high schoolers on tech and mentoring at NEORIS Labs taught me this: The sparkle of curiosity in a junior's eyes is unmatched. Guiding students and young
    enthusiasts in their learning journey is not just a job; it's a mission. This is why companies should prioritize providing these opportunities whenever
    possible.

    Consider the Argentine football (soccer) team. With Scaloni, a relatively inexperienced coach at the helm, they clinched the world title. Experience isn't
    just years; it's passion, dedication, and the ability to bring out the best in your team. Scaloni might have been a Jr in terms of coaching experience, but
    he had the heart of a Sr.

    In tech, while we often talk AI and IoT, let's not forget T.E.A.M: Together Everyone Achieves More. The synergy between Jrs and Srs is what makes a team
    truly thrive.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">So, to every Sr, mentor passionately. To every Jr, your path to becoming a Sr is forged by curiosity.</p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 font-bold">Remember, without a Jr, there's no Sr.</p>
