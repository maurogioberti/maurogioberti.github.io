  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">ðŸš© Why NOT Use the Explicit Operator for Mapping in C#? ðŸ¤¨</h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Just because C# lets you do something, doesn't mean you should. Lately, I've seen guys using the <strong>explicit operator</strong> to map domain models to DTOs. 
    Looks fancy, using something new right? Well, not really you are just dumpling into new features without thinking it through. Here's a quick look:
  </p>

  <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-sm mb-4">
public class DomainModel
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Dto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public static explicit operator Dto(DomainModel model)
    {
        return new Dto
        {
            Id = model.Id,
            Name = model.Name
        };
    }
}

// Usage:
var domainModel = new DomainModel { Id = 1, Name = "Example" };
var dto = (Dto)domainModel;
  </pre>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    <strong>Sounds cool, but here's why it's not a great idea:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mb-6">
    <li><strong>Not intuitive:</strong> Casting should be for simple or related types, not business logic mapping.</li>
    <li><strong>Hides logic:</strong> <code>(Dto)domainModel</code> looks simple, but there's hidden magic going on.</li>
    <li><strong>Hard to maintain:</strong> As mapping grows, this gets messy. Reverse mapping? Even worse.</li>
    <li><strong>Breaks clean code:</strong> It surprises devs and mixes responsibilities.</li>
    <li><strong>It's just not the C# way:</strong> Most devs expect named methods or constructors for this stuff.</li>
    <li><strong>Not the purpose of the explicit operator:</strong> It's meant for low-level type conversions, not business logic.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    <strong>What's the real purpose of the <code>explicit operator</code>?</strong><br/>
    It's designed for <strong>controlled type conversions</strong> between types that are closely relatedâ€”like converting a value type to another value type, or turning a wrapper object into its underlying value. You use it when automatic (implicit) conversion doesn't make sense or could cause data loss. <br/>
    <br/>
    In fact: it's for low-level data conversions, <strong>not</strong> for mapping business objects or models.
  </p>

  <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-sm mb-4">
public struct Meters
{
    public double Value { get; }
    public Meters(double value) => Value = value;
    public static explicit operator double(Meters m) => m.Value;
}

// Usage:
Meters meters = new Meters(12.5);
double metersAsDouble = (double)meters; // Explicit, not automatic!
</pre>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 px-4 py-3 mb-6 text-blue-900 italic font-semibold">
    The <strong>explicit operator</strong> is <u>not</u> meant for mapping business models. This isn't about performanceâ€”<br />
    it's about <strong>clarity of intent</strong> and <strong>maintainability</strong>. Use explicit operators for tight type conversions, not for business object mapping.
  </blockquote>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">âœ… Clean Code: Keep It Simple & Obvious</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    If Uncle Bob saw your code, he'd want mapping to be <strong>obvious</strong> and <strong>easy to find</strong>. No tricks, no surprises.
    The best way? A simple static method or a clear constructor that tells you exactly what's happening:
  </p>

  <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-sm mb-4">
public class Dto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public static Dto FromDomainModel(DomainModel model)
    {
        return new Dto
        {
            Id = model.Id,
            Name = model.Name
        };
    }
}

// Usage:
var dto = Dto.FromDomainModel(domainModel);
  </pre>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Or just a regular constructor on your DTO. No magic, no guessing. If mapping ever gets more complex or needs to be reused across your app, that's when you move the logic to a dedicated <code>Mapper</code> class. 
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Keep it simple, keep it readable.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ”‘ The Takeaway</h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    <strong>Don't jump on every new C# feature</strong> just because it's there. If it doesn't make your code better, just skip it.
    So think twice and ask yourself: "Does this really make my code better?". Classic solutions win: your team and your future self will thank you!
