    🤖 Why ATS Matters More Than Ever
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Not getting interviews?<br/>
    Not getting callbacks?<br/>
    Sending resumes and hearing nothing back?
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Most of the time, the problem is not your experience.<br/>
    It's that your resume is being filtered <strong>before a human ever sees it</strong>.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600 mb-8">
    A Sunday night rejection email.<br/>
    No interview. No feedback. No human interaction.<br/>
    <strong>Smells like ATS filtering.</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
    The first filter is not a person anymore
  </h2>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Today, almost every medium or large company uses an <strong>ATS (Applicant Tracking System)</strong>.
    And ATS systems don't “read” resumes like humans do.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    They parse text. They score content. They look for structure, clarity, and keywords.
    If your resume can't be properly read by a machine, it simply disappears.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
    Design is no longer the priority
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    For years, resumes were about visual impact: columns, icons, colors, fancy layouts.
    That worked when humans were the first readers.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4 text-red-700 font-semibold">
    Beware: a beautiful design can work against you. If your resume is too fancy, the ATS might not read it correctly and your application could be rejected before a human ever sees it.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Today, <strong>clarity beats design</strong>.
    ATS systems (and AI models) care about:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mb-6">
    <li><strong>- Plain text structure</strong></li>
    <li><strong>- Clear section titles</strong></li>
    <li><strong>- Simple layouts</strong></li>
    <li><strong>- Bullet points</strong></li>
    <li><strong>- Readable PDFs (or even Markdown)</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
    Text matters more than format
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Whether your resume is a PDF, a DOCX, or even Markdown,
    what really matters is that it can be <strong>easily parsed</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg mb-4 text-blue-700 font-semibold">
    Keep it simple: clarity and structure matter more than visual tricks. Make your resume easy for machines to read.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    No hidden text, no weird columns, no visual tricks.
    If an AI can't understand it, it can't score it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
    ATS + AI changed the game
  </h2>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
    Modern ATS platforms don't just extract text anymore.
    They use <strong>AI models to score resumes</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    This is not about gaming the system.<br/>
    It's about <strong>not confusing it</strong>.
  </p>


  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
    Credibility matters more than ever
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Public projects, GitHub repositories, technical blogs,
    open-source contributions — anything verifiable —
    increases trust and improves scoring.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-6 text-green-700 italic">
    <strong>Note:</strong> ATS and AI now perform deep searches—cross-referencing your public work, profiles, and contributions. The more verifiable your achievements, the better your chances.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
    The takeaway
  </h2>
  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    In 2024, ATS-ready resumes are no longer optional.
    This is not a trend. It's the new baseline.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base mb-6 text-purple-700 italic">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Since 2024, this has become the new standard for over 90% of companies. If your resume isn’t ATS-ready, you’re likely missing out.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6 italic">
    So, if you’ve been left out of the process, think twice: maybe your resume wasn’t optimized for an AI to read it properly. It’s not just about what you’ve done—it’s about making sure the right systems can see it.
