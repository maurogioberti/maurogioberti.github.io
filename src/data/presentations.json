    "description": "This session explores how smart automation practices from a developer's perspective can drastically reduce bugs, cut costs, and accelerate delivery before issues reach QA or production environments.<br/><br/>Through language-agnostic concepts and real-world examples in modern architectures like microservices, database integrations, and event-driven systems. The talk demonstrates how fast, repeatable tests build confidence, improve workflows, and lead to more reliable software.<br/><br/>Whether you're working with monoliths or distributed systems, this talk offers practical takeaways to help you automate smarter and develop with peace of mind.<br/>",
