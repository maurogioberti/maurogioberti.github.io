    "description": "In this talk 🗣️, we explore how developers can write E2E automated tests🤖 in their own language to validate APIs and event-driven workflows using real infrastructure.<br>We gonna spin up a microservice with Docker 🐳, connect it to a test project that runs inserts, updates, deletes, and checks responses (HTTP status codes, database state, and event bus triggers). Although we use a microservice example, this strategy applies to any type of system🤝.<br>This developer🧑‍💻 focused automation doesn’t replace QA, this complements it. While QA teams may use other tools for automation, these early-stage checks help catch bugs sooner, improve developer confidence, and reduce back and forth in the delivery cycle.<br>The result? Faster⏱️ delivery🚀, fewer misunderstandings😵 between Dev and QA, and significant cost savings 💸💸 by catching issues before they hit production.<br>So it's a real-world solution, not a theoretical talk with working code, infrastructure, and a model for testing integrated systems early and effectively.",
