  I provide <strong>clear</strong> and <strong>impartial</strong> technical interviews to assess 
  candidates <strong>skills</strong> and alignment with <strong>role expectations</strong>. 
  Using <strong>extensive experience</strong> and cognitive techniques 
  like <strong>Follow-up Questions</strong> and <strong>Memory Recall</strong>, 
  I identify <strong>genuine expertise</strong> and ensure <strong>authenticity</strong> through 
  strategic problem-solving exercises.
